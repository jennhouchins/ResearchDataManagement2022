	abstract = {The results of educational research studies are only as accurate as the data used to produce them. Drawing on experiences conducting large-scale efficacy studies of classroom-based algebra interventions for community college and middle school students, I am developing practice-based data cleaning procedures to support scholars in conducting rigorous research. The paper identifies common sources of data errors in mathematics education research and offers a framework and related data cleaning process designed to address these errors.

	abstract = {Widespread sharing of data and materials (including displays and text- and video-based descriptions of experimental procedures) will improve the reproducibility of psychological science and accelerate the pace of discovery. In this article, we discuss some of the challenges to open sharing and offer practical solutions for researchers who wish to share more of the products and process of their research. Many of these solutions were devised by the Databrary.org data library for storing and sharing video, audio, and other forms of sensitive or personally identifiable data. We also discuss ways in which researchers can make shared data and materials easier for others to find and reuse. Widely adopted, these solutions and practices will increase transparency and speed progress in psychological science.},
