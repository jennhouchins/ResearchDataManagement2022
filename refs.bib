	abstract = {The results of educational research studies are only as accurate as the data used to produce them. Drawing on experiences conducting large-scale efficacy studies of classroom-based algebra interventions for community college and middle school students, I am developing practice-based data cleaning procedures to support scholars in conducting rigorous research. The paper identifies common sources of data errors in mathematics education research and offers a framework and related data cleaning process designed to address these errors.
