The book Data Management in Large-Scale Education Research begins with this quote from my WestEd colleague Aleata Hubbard Cheuoua in the preamble. The results of educational research studies are only as accurate as the data used to produce them.

**_The results of educational research studies are only as accurate as the data used to produce them._**

::: {.notes}
Let's pause just a moment to let that sink in. The results of educational research studies (that's the work we are all doing here) are ONLY AS ACCURATE as the data used to produce them.

## What is research data management?

It's the <span style='color: #0456B4;'>_**organization, storage, preservation, and dissemination of research study data**_</span> (i.e., the materials generated or collected throughout the research process). [@DataManagementLargeScale]
<br />
<br />
These can be:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- physical or digital files
- documentation
- artifacts 
:::
:::{.column width=50%}
- audio or video recordings
- researcher observations/field notes
:::
::::

## Major Components of Research Data Management

- Documentation
- Data Collection Process
- Style Guides
- Data Cleaning
- Data Sharing

## Documentation

<br>Data documentation (including a data management plan) <span style='color: red;'>_**is required by funders**_</span> (e.g., NSF and IES).
<br>
<br>
This should include the <span style='color: #0456B4;'>_**who, what, where, when, and why**_</span> of your project's data management lifecycle.

## Documentation - Who and What
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
<span style='color: #0456B4;'>**Who:**</span>

- Who is collecting the data?
- Who/What are the subjects under study?
:::
:::{.column width=50%}
<span style='color: #0456B4;'>**What:**</span>

- What data are collected? For what purpose
- What do these data contain? How is it structured?
:::
::::
## Documentation - Where and When
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
<span style='color: #0456B4;'>**Where:**</span>

- Where were these data collected?
- What were the experimental conditions?
:::
:::{.column width=50%}
<span style='color: #0456B4;'>**When:**</span>

- When were these data collected?
- Is there a timeline for the collection?
  
:::
::::

## Documentation - Why

<span style='color: #0456B4;'>**Why:**</span>

- Why were these data collected?
- How do these data relate to your research questions?


## Data Collection {.smaller}

You've planned... :white_check_mark:

You've proposed... :white_check_mark:

Your proposal was accepted... :white_check_mark:

<br>
<span style='color: red;'>**Before you do anything else**</span>, you have to get approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

<br>
IRB:

- is designated to review and monitor human participant research
- ensures that the welfare, rights, and privacy of research participants are maintained throughout a project 

## Risk Considersations for Data Collection {.smaller}

<br>
```{r}
Classification <- c("<span style='color: green;'>**Not sensitive**</span>", 
                    "<span style='color: #e6b400;'>**Moderately sensitive**</span>",
                    "<span style='color: red;'>**Highly sensitive**</span>", 
                    "<span style='color: purple;'>**Ultra-sensitive**</span>")
Risk <- c("little to none", "moderate to low", "high risk", "very high risk")
Example <- c("name, address, educational attainment level, field of study", 
             "date of birth, race, gender, transcripts, and disability status or type", 
             "driver's license, mother's maiden name, passport, or immigration number", 
             "social security numbers, passwords, encryption keys, and biometrics such as fingerprints and iris scans")

df <- data.frame(Classification, Risk, Example)

knitr::kable(df, 
             col.names = c("Classification", "Risk Level", "Data Examples"))
```


:::{.notes}
The type of data you're collecting will determine what the level of risk is if the data is somehow exposed. NC State's Office of Information Technology classifies data with four levels.

These classification levels will determine how you can store your data. For example, red, highly sensitive data CANNOT be stored on regular Google Drive. You have to used a Google Shared Drive.

## Style Guides

- Set conventions that reduce chance for errors and ensure reproducibility
- Includes standardization of file structures, file naming and versioning, variable naming, and value coding.
- Clear and consistent structure help you always understand your own process!

## Standard Structure

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

<span style='color: #0456B4;'>**Data cleaning**</span>

1. Import raw data
2. Wrangle
3. Explore
4. Export clean data file<br>(:heavy_exclamation_mark: don't overwrite :heavy_exclamation_mark:)
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
<span style='color: #0456B4;'>**Analysis**</span>

1. Import clean data
2. Perform analyses
3. Produce visualizations
4. Export results and visualizations

:::
::::

:::{.notes}
Check structure (# of rows and cols)
Check rows for duplicate participants or non-consented participants who need to be removed
Compare against a roster (participant tracking)
Check columns against data dictionary
Any additional variables not in data dictionary?
Missing any variables?
Check variable classes
Update classes as needed
Rename variables according to data dictionary
Recategorize open-ended variables d and f
Reverse coded variable a, b, c
Name new variables according to data dictionary
Check reverse scoring
Create sum and mean scores x, y, and z
Name new variables according to data dictionary
Add variable labels and value codes for all variables
Run validation to check ranges of all variables

## Data Sharing {.smaller}

Funders are starting to require data sharing plans and there is a general movement toward [**Open Science**](https://osf.io/). @gilmorePracticalSolutionsSharing2018 share challenges to data sharing and some practical solutions.

<br>IES suggests:

- Focus on sharing well-organized and well-documented data
- Commit to sharing some data or code to facilitate analysis
- Donâ€™t get stuck on one single way to share data
- There may be times when sharing all of your data requires you to share with restricted access, while removing some variables and sharing only some of your data allows you to share the dataset openly.

## Best Practices?
